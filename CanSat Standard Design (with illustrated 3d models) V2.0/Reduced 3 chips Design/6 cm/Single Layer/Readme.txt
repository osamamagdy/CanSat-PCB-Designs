This is the most simple design (Also the first to come to your mind) you can get,it depends on a single layer design for each chip
 (lower cost for manufacturing).
It has the problem of that if we wanted to take the pins of the ATMega to make additional chip, we will need to make the design 
for the chips depends on double layer design but this isn't the best solution as the structure of the cansat cannot hold 4 chips 
(due to dimensions issues),which means there isn't a room to the additional chip.
